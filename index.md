			<p>The brown long-eared bat or common long-eared bat is a small Eurasian insectivorous bat. It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold. 
				It is extremely similar to the much rarer grey long-eared bat. The ears readily distinguish the long-eared bats from most other bat species. 
				They are relatively slow flyers compared to other bat species.
